E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis
------------------------------------------

1. Project Title:
   E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

2. Objective:
   To identify the reasons behind product returns and analyze return rates across product categories, geographic regions, and marketing channels. 
   Additionally, build a predictive model to forecast return probability and develop a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and high-risk items.

3. Tools and Technologies Used:
   - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - SQL
   - Power BI

4. Dataset Description:
   - Orders Dataset: Includes product details, customer info, category, order dates, and region.
   - Returns Dataset: Contains information about returned items and reasons (if available).

5. Methodology:

   A. Data Cleaning:
      - Removed duplicates and null values.
      - Standardized formats and merged datasets.
      - Feature engineering: return_flag, days_to_return.

   B. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      - Analyzed return rates by category, region, and channel.
      - Visualized high-return product types and suppliers.
      - Identified trends using bar charts and heatmaps.

   C. Predictive Modeling:
      - Target variable: Return (1) or Not Return (0)
      - Features: Category, Supplier, Price, Delivery Time, Region, Marketing Channel
      - Model: Logistic Regression
      - Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC
      - Outcome: Probability of return per product

   D. Power BI Dashboard:
      - Interactive dashboard with filters (Category, Region, Supplier)
      - Visualizations of return trends, risk scores, and high-risk SKUs
      - Drill-through pages for detailed product analysis

6. Key Findings:
   - Certain categories and suppliers have significantly higher return rates.
   - Products with longer delivery times are more likely to be returned.
   - Returns are also higher in specific regions and via certain marketing channels.

7. Deliverables:
   - Python codebase for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling
   - Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations and filters
   - CSV of high-risk products with predicted return probability > 0.6

8. Business Impact:
   - Helps reduce operational cost from excessive returns
   - Supports decision-making for inventory, marketing, and quality control
   - Enables targeting high-risk products with better size guides, quality checks, and marketing strategies

9. Conclusion:
   The project successfully implemented a data-driven approach to identify and reduce return rates in e-commerce. The logistic model and dashboard empower stakeholders to take actionable steps in reducing product returns.
